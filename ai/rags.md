# Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## Notes

### 2024/01/12

The [Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997v1.pdf) paper was an OK read. It touches on a few different approaches to designing a RAG. However, the paper was a bit lacking. It provided a colleciton of different resources as opposed to a synthesis of how the different architecture designs work and the tradeoffs involved. 

It would have also been helpful to connect the academic discourse to practical applications in the wild, which the paper did not go into.
